## Week 6: Java 8 Features

### Day 01: Lambda Expressions, Method References & Interfaces
**Date:** 27-Jan-2026

- Set up and revised the java8-programming-practice branch structure.
- Studied Java 8 goals and functional-programming concepts.
- Learned lambda expression syntax and target typing.
- Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
- Practiced method references:
   - Static, and instance forms
   - Constructor references  
- Applied Java-8 best practices.
- Solved practice problems and committed all work.

### Day 03: Interfaces (Functional, Marker and static Default methods)
**Date:** 28-Jan-2026

- Implemented different types of interfaces in Java.
- Worked with **Marker Interfaces** for tagging and conditional behavior.
- Used **Static methods in interfaces** for utility-style functionality.
- Implemented **Default methods** to provide common behavior across classes.
- Created and used **Functional Interfaces** for lambda expression support.
- Practiced real-world Problems.
- Committed and pushed all solutions.

### Day 04: Stream API (Java 8)
**Date:** 29-Jan-2026

- Studied Java 8 Stream API for functional-style data processing.
- Practiced **intermediate operations**: `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `distinct`, `sorted`, `peek`, `limit`, `skip`.
- Used **terminal operations**: `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`.
- Understood **stateless vs stateful operations**  
  (e.g., `filter` – stateless; `sorted`, `distinct` – stateful).
- Learned differences between **ordered and unordered streams**.
- Worked with **parallel streams** and their behavior.
- Compared `forEach()` in **Iterable vs Stream** context.
- Implemented real world questions and committed all code.
