### 🗓️ Day 11 – Static, Final & Type Checking  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Used static keyword for shared values and utility methods to:
  - Reduce memory usage  
  - Avoid code redundancy   
- Leveraged static context to avoid ambiguity while initializing attributes 
- Declared final variables for identifiers and constants that must remain unchanged  
- Used instanceof operator for:
  - Safe type checking
  - Preventing runtime errors during type casting

### 🗓️ Day 12 – UML Diagrams: Class & Sequence Diagrams
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

- Learned **Class Diagrams** to represent the static structure of a system by:
  - Defining classes, attributes, and methods
  - Showing relationships between classes
- Understood key class relationships including:
  - Association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance
- Studied **Sequence Diagrams** to model dynamic behavior by:
  - Showing interaction between objects
  - Representing the order of method calls over time
- Used UML diagrams to improve system design clarity and object interaction understanding
