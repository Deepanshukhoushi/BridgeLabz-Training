### 🗓️ Day 11 – Static, Final & Type Checking  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Used static keyword for shared values and utility methods to:
  - Reduce memory usage  
  - Avoid code redundancy   
- Leveraged static context to avoid ambiguity while initializing attributes 
- Declared final variables for identifiers and constants that must remain unchanged  
- Used instanceof operator for:
  - Safe type checking
  - Preventing runtime errors during type casting

### 🗓️ Day 12 – UML Diagrams: Class & Sequence Diagrams
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

- Learned **Class Diagrams** to represent the static structure of a system by:
  - Defining classes, attributes, and methods
  - Showing relationships between classes
- Understood key class relationships including:
  - Association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance
- Studied **Sequence Diagrams** to model dynamic behavior by:
  - Showing interaction between objects
  - Representing the order of method calls over time
- Used UML diagrams to improve system design clarity and object interaction understanding

### 🗓️ Day 13 – Inheritance
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

- Learned Java Inheritance to reuse properties and behaviors from parent classes  
- Implemented single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance  
- Practiced method overriding to modify parent class behavior safely  
- Used `super()` to invoke parent class constructors  
- Applied inheritance with polymorphism for dynamic method dispatch  
- Understood access control using public, protected, default, and private members
